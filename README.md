# Programming-and-Algorithms-FEIT

Course Goals (acquired competencies): Introduction to programming. Concepts of programming and algorithms. After finishing the course the student will be able to write simple and more complex programmes in C programming language.
* Modeling software solutions and implementing them in C programming language.
* Profound understanding of data variables, code branching and programming cycles.
* Understanding arrays and matrixes, programming with multi-dimensional variables.
* Programming recursive functions and writing code to work with text files.

Course Syllabus: Introduction to computer systems, components and organisation: processor, registers, memory. Programming. Programming languages. Syntax and semantics. Structure of a C program. Data types. Constants. Variables and types of variables. Operators. Logical and relational operations. Expressions. Basin input/output expressions. Commands for execution control of a program: branching statements (if-else, switch), repeating statements (for, while). Functions. Recursive functions. Complex program structures. Arrays. Pointers and pointer operations. Matrix. Concepts of searching through complex data structures. Ways of sorting. Textual arrays. Arguments in main() function. File concepts and structure.
